yaffs2utils
-----------
The yaffs2utils is the collection of utilities to make/extract a YAFFS2/YAFFS1
image for Linux.

Currently, it inclueds the following tools:
(1) mkyaffs2: making a yaffs2 (yaffs1) image 
(2) unyaffs2: extract a yaffs2 (yaffs1) image made by mkyaffs2.
(3) unspare2: extract the spare(oob) layout from the NAND device.

This project is developed under the Debian Linux 5 (code Lenny). It can make a
yaffs2 image to be ran under my embedded system (Linux 2.6.20), and extract a
yaffs2 image made by itself. 

Due to some lack of the official utilities from yaffs2.net (A image made from
its "mkyaffs2image" tool cannot be ran normally under my embedded system because
of the wrong OOB origination), I re-wrote it almost and create the "mkyaffs2"
tool to make a yaffs2 image for Linux 2.6.20. A tool named "unyaffs2" is also
provided to extract the image made from its "mkyaffs2". The license for this 
package is stated as GPLv2 only.

Making a yaffs1 image to be ran properly is NOT verified, since I don't have an
embedded system device with the old NAND flash (512k page). I will be glad if
someone can help me to verify the integrity to make and extract a yaffs1 image.

HOWTO
-----
Building the source by "make", then enjoying them.


Usage
-----
* mkyaffs2

	./mkyaffs2 [-h] [-e] [-p pagesize] [-o oobimg] dirname imgfile

* unyaffs2

	./unyaffs2 [-h] [-e] [-p pagesize] [-o oobimg] [-f file] imgfile dirname

* unspare2

	./unspare2 [-h] [-e] devfile imgfile

After making a yaffs2 image, the tool "nandwrite" in the mtd-utils can be used
ro recode data into the flash (with oob option), such as:

	nandwrite -a -o /dev/mtd${MTDNUM} ${YAFFS2IMAGE}

If the oob layout is differed from the Linux default, the tool "unspare2" can
be used to extract the oob layout from the NAND device. If the endian is 
different from your building system, the option "-e" is required while executing
the "unspare2" on the targets. Finally, by the option '-o' to specify the oob
image while using the "mkyaffs2/unyaffs2" can create/extract the YAFFS image
with the various oob layout for the different NAND devices.


LICENSE
-------
Except files under "src/yaffs2", yaffs2utils is published as GNU GPL version 2.
Files under "src/yaffs2" are branched from the official YAFFS2 and their license
are announced in their header.


TODO
----
1. Verify the implementation for yaffs1 images.
2. Extract the runtime image dumpped directly from the NAND flash.


NOTE
----
Files under "src/yaffs2" is branched from the official YAFFS2 dated 20101227,
because of the compiling issues about the inconstant naming rules in the
official YAFFS2 source. These files are required by the current yaffs2utils.
I will continue updating these files untils the oficial source is integrated
into the Linux kernel or it has a stable release.
